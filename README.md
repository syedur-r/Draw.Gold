At this stage of the final project, we have finished generating ideas, designing the application, and simply created a foundation of the
drawing application. We have used the code template from case study 1, and plan to change the code structure using ES6 classes and objects rather than constructor functions. In the future, we also plan to add extra elements along with some of the existing elements from case study one. These include:

- Adding more colours and possibly an rgb colour wheel - DONE
- Adding a brush tool, pen tool, line tool, shape tool, editable shapes,
  text, resizing the canvas - DONE 
- Adding a slider value to increase/decrease the stroke of the brush/pen - DONE
- Increasing the canvas size so the user has more drawing space - DONE
- Adding a loading page for the app using the preload() function - DONE

We also plan to restructure the design of the drawing app i.e. the allocation of each element, the allocation of the buttons and the heading so it looks more visually attractive and professional.

We are currently working on making sure the app looks the way we designed it. The person reviewing our code will find blank and missing elements in some files. The reason why most of the files are empty is because we have deleted it at this time, due to multiple errors as we are switching to the use of ES6 classes. We are planning to complete the graphics of each element first and then progress onto the implemenetation of the functionality of the element.

If any errors arise in the future, we will deal with them appropriately, whether it be using the debugging tools or asking the module leader for any tips. If it comes to a point where thre problem cannot be solved, then we will change back to using constructor functions or completely remove the functionality.
